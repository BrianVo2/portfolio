The project was in a website called, "MIT APP INVENTOR" and our job is to find a game subject and make it into our own creation with similar content and putting the game in an android app of the MIT APP INVENTOR. We were doing great for making that that project. We add details and parts we wanted it to be, it turns out what we wanted to be but there are still a little glitches in there, and I get to understand how to work with coding from it. I was making and coding the game and Shriya was giving me ideas and writing info about the game</h3></th>
